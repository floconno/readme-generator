# readme-generator

## Description
This repository contains two JavaScript files that work together utilizing Node.js and Inquirer to create a command-line application that generates a README.md file for the user. The application is first invoked by the user by running node index.js in the command-line. The user is then prompted to answer questions and provide details about their project and what they would like the contents of their README.md to be. The prompts cover each section of a quality README and give the user the ability to fine tune their responses to have a README customized to their needs. Once the user has completed the prompt in the command-line, a README.md file is generated for the user, containing the information they entered about their project. This is a great tool for any developer looking to include a quality README to their repository that will provide any reader with all the information they need to learn about the project!
